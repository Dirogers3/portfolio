    <h1>W1 Notes</h1>
    <p>This week we are just getting the portfolio site all set up! I have a decent folder structure here.</p>
    <p>We did some review reading.</p>
    <h2>Notes from the video</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Mobile websites have skyrocketed, basically replacing computers. </li>
        <li>Computers are replaced ever 4-5 years while phones are 2 years. People have 2-3 devices per person.</li>
        <li>Mobile first for websites, while time consuming it gives a better experience and help with bandwidth.</li>
        <li>Be there, Be useful, and be quick. Use these rules when you cream your applications.</li>
        <li>Reach ability on the mobile phone with a one handed grip.</li>
        <li>Speed maters: Reduce image usage and use SVG/Webfonts, Optimize and Minify CSS and JS files, use GZIP files
            eliminate not needed data.
        </li>
        <li>Most commonly used items should be at the bottom of the screen or where people can reach with one hand.</li>
        <li>Hamburger menu isn't generally known. But using the word "menu" with a border has the highest amount of clicks</li>
        <li>Enable auto complete on forms if possible.</li>
        <li>Make phone number clickable to call when having on mobile websites.</li>
        <li>Keep ads unintrusive and simple.</li>
    </ul>
