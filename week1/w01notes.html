    <h1>W1 Notes</h1>
    <p>This week we are just getting the portfolio site all set up! I have a decent folder structure here.</p>
    <p>We did some review reading.</p>
    <h2>Notes from the video</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Mobile websites have skyrocketed, basically replacing computers. </li>
        <li>Computers are replaced ever 4-5 years while phones are 2 years. People have 2-3 devices per person.</li>
        <li>Mobile first for websites, while time consuming it gives a better experience and help with bandwidth.</li>
    </ul>
